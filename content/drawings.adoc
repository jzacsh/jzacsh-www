Below are some scanned drawings from a time when I filled multiple new pages
per-day in a sketchbook. Some drawings here _may_ also be vector drawings,
created in {inkscape}[inkscape] with a wacom bamboo tablet ({nerdsvg}[eg "nerd
friend"]).

Lastly, I've started doodling a bit on the go, in a {doodleurl}[*doodle* mobile
app I created] ({burrito}[eg "burrito riding bicycle"]).

== What's Shown Here
Work shown below is a randomly loaded subset of my scanned work _(until I find
time to create something nice small screens)_. In the meantime, feel free to

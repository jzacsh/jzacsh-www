Generally, if I feel something's worth sharing with friends, family, industry,
I'll share it through some social networking outlet (_eg.: Google+, Twitter_).
Below are most likely things I had fun learning and want to nerd-out about.

<!--%
from datetime import datetime
posts = [p for p in pages if "post" in p] # get all blog post pages
posts.sort(key=lambda p: p.get("date"), reverse=True) # sort post pages by date
for p in posts:
    date = datetime.strptime(p.date, "%Y-%m-%d").strftime("%B %d, %Y")
    print "  * **[%s](%s)** - %s" % (p.post, p.url, date) # markdown list item
%-->

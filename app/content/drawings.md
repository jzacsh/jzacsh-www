Below are some scanned drawings from a time when I filled multiple new pages
per-day in a sketchbook. Some drawings here _may_ also be vector drawings, created in
[inkscpae](https://inkscape.org) with a wacom bamboo tablet _([eg "nerd
friend"](https://googledrive.com/host/0B61bPXQ61mAFR0NmaThNSVNZSVU/20100519_001_nerd-friend.svg))_.

Lastly, I've started doodling a bit on the go, in a [**doodle** mobile-app I
created](/doodle) _([eg "burrito
riding bicycle"](https://googledrive.com/host/0B61bPXQ61mAFR0NmaThNSVNZSVU/burrito-riding-bicycle.jpg))_.


### What's Shown Here
Work shown below is a randomly loaded subset of my scanned work _(until I find
time to create something nice small screens)_. In the meantime, feel free to
[checkout the full listing](https://googledrive.com/host/0B61bPXQ61mAFR0NmaThNSVNZSVU)
of what's scanned.
